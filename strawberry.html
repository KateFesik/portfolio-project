          <strong>Once available in Britain</strong> for just a brief period
          during the summer, strawberries are now a year-round fruit, thanks to
          imports from warmer climates. However, the varieties grown for export
          tend to be chosen for their ability to withstand transportation,
          rather than for their texture or flavour, which often results in a
          less tender berry with an unremarkable taste. The fact that
          strawberries intended for export are picked before they‚Äôre properly
          ripe, means that their flavour is further impaired; strawberries don‚Äôt
          ripen after being picked.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enjoy strawberries at their fragrant, juicy and flavourful best
          it‚Äôs worth holding out for the British season ‚Äì if you want to eat
          them super-ripe, pick-your-own is best

          Imports are available all year round, but the British season runs from
          late May to early September. Strawberries are easy to grow in the
          garden or in a pot on a sunny windowsill ‚Äì just remember to protect
          them from birds when the fruits appear! Learn how to grow your own
          strawberries from the experts.
